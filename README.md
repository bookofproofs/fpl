FPL, the Formal Proving Language, is a specification for an artificial language 
that is going to serve as a universal language to formulate
mathematical definitions, theorems, and proofs independently of 
local natural languages. 

# Important Note
This Fpl Parser and FPL Interpreter branch was discontinued. For a continuation, check out the new 
[fpl.net](https://github.com/bookofproofs/fpl.net) repository where we continue
the Proof of Concept (PoC) of developing a working FPL parser and FPL interpreter.

This old repo (fpl) is kept for reference purposes only.
