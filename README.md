# FPL
FPL - the "Formal Proving Language" is a project to create a universal, 
human-readable language to formulate mathematical definitions, theorems, 
and proofs. 

These is the main goal of the project and you are invited to collaborate.

FPL is not (!)
* yet another automated prove assistant 
* yet another automated theorem proving tool.

In fact, it is not a tool at all! It is more a specification for a 
human-readable language that can be used by mathematicians all over the world
regardless their origin and native language so that a theory written in FPL
can be read and understood by everyone who also knows FPL.

At the same time, FPL should be formal enough to enable programmers to 
implement FPL tools that are able to:
* parse and translate code written in FPL into an arbitrary human 
local language,
* verify, if code written in FPL is logically
consistent (i.e. without contradictions), 
* find a proof for a theorem written in FPL, given a theory written in FPL, 
i.e. other theorems, definitions, and axioms written in FPL, and  
* generate theories based on axioms written in FPL.

The FPL specification follows some seemingly contradicting principles:

### Principle 1: Readability

Code written in FPL should be not only human-readable but also catchy, 
memorable, and easy to learn so that FPL can be learned even by 
non-programmers.

### Principle 2: Richness

The syntax of FPL should be inspired by modern mathematical notation while 
preserving the readability principle.


### Principle 3: Extendability

The syntax of FPL should allow adding any new definitions and theorems, 
while encouraging standard notation for common mathematical concepts.

### Principle 4: Formalism

The syntax of FPL should facilitate automated aids and solutions.
